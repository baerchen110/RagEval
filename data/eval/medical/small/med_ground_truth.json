Martinez\n\nPost-Admission Course Records:\nFirst Course Record:\nPatient admitted with suspected peptic ulcer disease based on symptoms and initial endoscopic findings. Initial management includes proton pump inhibitors, antacids, and dietary modifications. Pending further evaluation and dietary consultation.\n\nDaily Course Records:\nDay 2: Symptoms persist but slightly improved with medication. Continued PPI and antacids. Started dietary modifications with small, frequent meals.\nDay 3: Patient reports less frequent episodes of pain and heartburn. Continued medication and dietary regimen.\n\nSenior Physician Rounds Records:\nReviewed by senior physician Dr. L. Wang; agreed with ongoing management plan, no immediate need for surgical intervention.\n\nDifficult Case Discussion Records:\nNot applicable.\n\nHandover Records:\nHandover to on-call team completed with detailed overview of the case, current management plan, and pending evaluations.\n\nTransfer Records:\nNot applicable.\n\nStage Summary:\nPatient showing signs of improvement on medical management.

Knowing the type of ulcer, such as peptic, stress-related, or H. pylori-associated, can inform treatment decisions and offer insights for research into potential causes and treatments. It supports clinical practice by prompting consideration of diagnostic criteria and possible implications for patient care.\n\n",

      "standalone_eval": "This question is quite specific and assumes that the reader is familiar with the context of a medical procedure, specifically an upper GI endoscopy. The question assumes the existence of a duodenal bulb ulcer, which suggests prior medical knowledge or information about a particular patient's case. Without additional background information, such as details from a medical record or a previous conversation, the question is not easily understood. Thus, it is not fully context-independent.\n\n"
