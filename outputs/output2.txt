Bilateral Cataract, more pronounced in the right eye
Diagnostic Basis:
Gradual onset of blurry vision, decreased visual acuity, and ophthalmic examination confirming lens opacities consistent with cataracts.
Differential Diagnosis:
Glaucoma ruled out due to normal intraocular pressure and absence of optic nerve damage. Age-related macular degeneration ruled out due to normal retinal appearance. Physiological lens aging considered but ruled out due to severity of visual impairment.

Preliminary Diagnosis:
Peptic Ulcer
Diagnostic Basis:
Based on history of upper abdominal pain with a burning sensation, acid reflux, heartburn, and supportive findings from the upper GI endoscopy.
Differential Diagnosis:
Gastric cancer ruled out due to the absence of malignant features on endoscopy; chronic gastritis less likely given the presence of a defined peptic ulcer; gastric neurosis less likely due to the presence of organic findings; cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and gastrinoma ruled out based on clinical presentation and endoscopy results.

After a certain incubation period, the symptoms recur. Severe cases can lead to complications such as anemia, hypoglycemia, acute renal failure, or acute pulmonary edema.\nDifferential Diagnosis: Malaria should be differentiated from various febrile diseases such as sepsis, typhoid, leptospirosis, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, schistosomiasis, biliary tract infections, and urinary tract infections. When it develops into cerebral malaria, it should be differentiated from Japanese encephalitis, moderate bacillary dysentery, sporadic viral encephalitis, etc.                                                                          What are the main symptoms of malaria?  The main symptoms of malaria are chills, high fever, sweating, headache, limb aches, and fatigue.  /Users/huagechen/PycharmProjects/RagEval/dragonball_docs_med_en.json

Osteoid Osteoma considered, but MRI pending confirmation.\n\nAdmission Records:\nPhysician's Signature: S. Martinez, MD\n\nPost-Admission Course Records:\nFirst Course Record: Admitted for further evaluation and management of suspected acute osteomyelitis. Plan includes blood cultures, MRI, intravenous antibiotics, and pain management.
